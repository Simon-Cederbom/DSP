What we have done:
We have created an internet chat service that different users can connect to and use to chat with eachother. Within the program you can send a message to all users connected to the server och just privately to a specific user. You can also change your user type to become a super user which can ban other users from the chat.

What we could have done more:
We could have created a GUI in order to make the program a bit easier to use. We could have created a JUnit test to test our program with and also to make it easier to add new features in the future.

How to use our program:
Run the server first and then you can run clients. Start by entering a name to initialize the client. You can send a message to all users connected to the server by just typing.
To send a private message you type @receiver where you change receiver to the name of the user you want to send your message to.
To change user type you just write -setPrivilege followed by a space and then either normal or super to select either normal user or super user.
If you are a super user you can type -ban followed by space and then the name of the user that you want to ban from the chat.
To quit you just type -quit.
